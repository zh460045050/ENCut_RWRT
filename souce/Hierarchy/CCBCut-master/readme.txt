This toolbox provides implementations of CCNCut and CCRCut minimization via
the IRRQ algorithm. Both multiway and hierarchical 2-way segmentations are
implemented. MATLAB version 2015b or later is required.

To run both algorithms, set MATLAB's current working directory to the 
directory in which this readme.txt file is in, and execute:

>> exampleScript

in MATLAB. This script will read in one of the BSDS500 test images and 
segment it according to various methods.
